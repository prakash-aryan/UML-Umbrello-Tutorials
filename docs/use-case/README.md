### Adjust Size and Position
One of the most important aspects of creating clear use case diagrams is properly positioning and sizing your elements. Here's how to do it:

#### Selecting Elements:
- Click the Select tool (arrow icon) in the toolbar
- Click on the element you want to adjust

#### Adjusting Position:
- With the element selected, click and hold the left mouse button
- Drag the element to the desired position
- Release the mouse button to place the element

#### Adjusting Size:
- Select the element you want to resize
- Look for the lines at the right-bottom corners of the element
- Click and drag the lines to adjust the size
- The bottom-right corner handle is most commonly used for proportional resizing

### Tips and Best Practices:
- Keep your diagram clean and organized
- Use clear, descriptive names for actors and use cases
- Ensure relationships make logical sense
- Save your work frequently
- Use the alignment tools to maintain neat appearance

## Keyboard Shortcuts
- Ctrl+S: Save
- Ctrl+Z: Undo
- Ctrl+Y: Redo
- Delete: Remove selected element

Remember to regularly save your work and maintain a clear, organized layout for your diagrams. Use case diagrams should be easy to understand and effectively communicate the system's functionality to stakeholders.
